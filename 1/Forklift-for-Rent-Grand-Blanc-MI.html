Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>
<p>Linde is constantly developing its order pickers, aiming to make working conditions even safer and more ergonomic for operators, which is why, for example, the latest generation of order picking devices feature an even lower entry height. Infinitely variable lift and lower control provides smooth control for precise platform work. Unlike Standard Counterbalance and Reach Forklifts, These forklifts are steered via the front swivel articulation of the forklift and are therefore much different to manoeuvre than regular forklifts and additionally have no pantograph feature for retrieving stock in narrow aisles.</p>
