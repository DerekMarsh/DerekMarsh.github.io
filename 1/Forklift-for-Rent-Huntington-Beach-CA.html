<p>Powered industrial trucks can either be ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator. Generally, the smallest capacity cushion available, the 3,000 lb. is a light-duty truck ideal for warehouses and production lines. A lifted truck has its suspension raised and may have its engine modified to be louder, creating a true white trash experience. Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks.</p>
<p>Operate forklift and reach truck. Because the dimensions of the machine, its weight, the counterbalance, and other elements will define the nominal load that the forklift can handle and lift.

The arm allows the operator flexibility in picking up and placing loads (at various distances and lift heights) from the front of the machine. Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>
<p>Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs.
