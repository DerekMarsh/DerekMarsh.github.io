<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.).

<p>If you need electric lift trucks, we carry a product for you. We are mainly looking for Hydraulic Jacks,Impact Wrench and pneumatic tools queries. The two basic types of lift kit are body lift and suspension lift. It should be noted that Lifted Trucks do have their drawbacks.
