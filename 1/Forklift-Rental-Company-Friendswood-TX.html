With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>
<p>While the machine is designed to work on rough terrain, it isn't always set to work on all types of terrain.

<p>For the development of modern Forklift Trucks, Hyster-Yale Materials plays a major role in bringing the connected device technology across the trucking industry. Some forklifts use a single hydraulic cylinder to elevate the boom, while others use two cylinders.
