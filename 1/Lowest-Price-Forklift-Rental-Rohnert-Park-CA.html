In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>

While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
