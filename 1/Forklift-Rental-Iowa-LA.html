<p>701 Powered industrial trucks may become hazardous if adequate maintenance is neglected. From new and used sales to fleet financing solutions to servicing and maintenance, your local Cat lift trucks and warehouse equipment dealer is ready to help when needed.

<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>
<p>Hydraulic Pallet Truck is designed with polyurethane rollers that allow the machine to operate easily.

If you've got one, you know washing a lifted truck can be tricky. Don't wait - our lifted trucks have a high interest and they won't last long.</p>
<h2>Lift Truck Rental Iowa</h2>
<p>I'd also like to say that I drive a truck, 2010 F-150 Platinum everyday to and from work and love trucks very dearly as I grew up driving them in Iowa. This is the most common type of forklift, used in warehouses and shipping centers all over the world. If you have never really thought much about lifted trucks before, then you might wonder why you would ever want a truck lifted up in the first place.</p>
<p>First, the fact that your forklift is rented means that you aren't solely responsible for its upkeep and maintenance. For more information about our Hyster and Yale forklifts, forklift attachments, and other heavy equipment for rent, please contact us today by calling (800)-447-3125 or stopping by any of our 13 locations across the southeast.
