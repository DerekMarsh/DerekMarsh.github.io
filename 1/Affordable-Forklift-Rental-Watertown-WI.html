<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
