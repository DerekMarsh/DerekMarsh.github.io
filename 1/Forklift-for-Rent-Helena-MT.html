<p>These lift trucks are meant to operate in narrow aisles and are best for storing and retrieving pallets in racks. The 44236 Series has two machines, with capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, offering lift heights up to 34 feet. These kinds of lift kits are popular because no work is necessary to adjust the suspension or other mechanical systems on the truck. These forklifts feature a simple, cost-effective Tier 4 Final solution.</p>
<p>Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them. The smaller design and increased maneuverability of narrow aisle forklifts allow them to reach tight areas and readily respond to unexpected hazards effectively.

<p>The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking. Order pickers feature an elevating platform that brings the operator to the level of the stock, similar to a cherry picker. The extra-long frame combined with a larger counterweight means this model can handle larger loads.</p>

While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
