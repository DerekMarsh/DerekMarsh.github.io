Rough terrain forklifts, often known as telehandlers, are engineered for operation on some of the most extreme terrain and climatic conditions. You may have to pay a premium on the maintenance and gas mileage of a lifted truck, but there are ways to save money on the purchase of lifted trucks.</p>
<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
