A hydraulic hand pump is powered by manual movement and meant for projects requiring portability. The "HD" in name on many of these trucks stands for "heavy duty" which is expertly brought out in full force thanks to these lifts and customizations as well as their trim levels and available engines.</p>

<p>Capable of lifting 20,000 pounds, this is the latest of Load Lifter's high-visibility forklifts.
