<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

<h2>Powered Pallet Truck Hortonville</h2>
<p>Space the fork evenly from the center stringer of the pallet to balance the load. You would have to determine whether or not you are operating on a ramp, how heavy the load is, the kind of condition the pallet truck is in, and the distance you have to cover.

<p>We have tons of lifted Chevy trucks, lifted Dodge trucks, lifted GMC trucks, lifted Jeeps, lifted SUVs, and more. Additionally, regular maintenance is necessary for gas forklifts to prevent breakdowns. Counterbalance forklifts are available in 4-wheel and 3-wheel configuration.
