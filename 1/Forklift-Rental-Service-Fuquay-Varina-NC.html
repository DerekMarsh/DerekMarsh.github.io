More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup.

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
