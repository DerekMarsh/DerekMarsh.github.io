<p>Caterpillar forklifts are notoriously powerful. A parking brake (or mechanism) which may be a part of, or include the service brake(s), shall be provided and be capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 10% grade, whichever is the lesser. The innovative 3-phase motors in our electric forklifts combine powerful performance with minimal consumption of power.</p>
<p>Imagine the devastation of crashing with a semi-truck - that's the kind of damage you can expect from a lifted vehicle. Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
