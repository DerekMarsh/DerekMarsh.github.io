China is expected to create attractive opportunities for the Pallet Trucks manufacturers followed by countries located in the South East Asia & Pacific and India.</p>
<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>

They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
