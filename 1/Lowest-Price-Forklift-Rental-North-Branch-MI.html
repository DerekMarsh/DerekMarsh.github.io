<p>Before you decide to lift your truck, it's important to understand some of the pros and cons of driving a lifted vehicle. If your forklift is overloaded, it can cause it to tip to the side when you turn or when you are near a steep edge. Forklifts run on diesel, liquid propane and electric. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
