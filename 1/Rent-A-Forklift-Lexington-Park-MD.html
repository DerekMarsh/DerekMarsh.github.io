Linde offers many additional options for all pallet trucks. The AM 22 hand pallet truck is also available in low-noise form. Counterbalance forklifts are very versatile and are available in three or four wheeled models, have two forks protruding from the front of the machine, and have a counterbalance weight in the back of the truck to ensure loads don't create an imbalance.</p>

<h3>Difference Between Forklifts Vs Pallet Jacks in Lexington Park MD 20653</h3>
<p>Aside from these two distinct types of a forklift, there are many other varieties available. Reach forklifts, also known as reach trucks, get their names from the distinctive way in which their fork carriages can ‘reach' into racking. Low noise and vibration, excellent all-round visibility and easy servicing allow for improved driver comfort and forklift truck durability.</p>
<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg). It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
