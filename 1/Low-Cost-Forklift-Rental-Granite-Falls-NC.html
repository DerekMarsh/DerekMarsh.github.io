This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments.

<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years.
