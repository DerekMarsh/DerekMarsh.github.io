<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>At Laura Buick GMC, we are the best lifted truck dealership near St Louis. So if you need additional materials handling equipment to keep your business up and running, we can help. A 2000kg load can be sufficiently moved with some effort; however, with poor ground, a poor quality pallet jack, unstable loads, slopes, etc., it will be much more difficult for the pallet jack worker.</p>
