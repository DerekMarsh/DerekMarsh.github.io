<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. We have uniquely positioned ourselves as a topmost enterprise, engaged in offering precision engineered Electrical Pallet Truck Truck. Even for shorter distances you need the performance of the transport truck, because the pallet trucks have to master many difficult situations in a short time: Narrow aisles, tight truck loading bays or steep ramps make goods receiving and transport difficult.</p>
<p>This added weight increases the lifting capacity of the unit to between 2,200 and 4,000 lb. The load center is the distance from the forks to the center of gravity of the load. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA. Built to lift boats in and out of tall storage racks while coping with the corrosive nature of seawater, marina forklifts are over-sized lifts with long, rubber-coated forks.</p>
