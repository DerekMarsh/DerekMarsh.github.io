If your company utilizes a very narrow aisle operation this classification of lift trucks is for you.</p>
<p>Choosing the right forklift for your business can be challenging and time consuming. How forklifts operate differently from a car. Their lift trucks start at 2,500 lbs weight lifts and go upwards of 125,000. For over 50 years, Liftking has grown to be the home of a complete line of Rough Terrain forklifts for both commercial and military clients. Stockpickers are used at elevations higher than the second level of racking in a warehouse or distribution center.</p>
<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48” will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work. One major difference between a forklift and a car is stability. That's why we invest heavily in keeping our rental fleet in optimum condition. Watrana is today a pioneer brand for forklifts and spare parts in India.</p>

The main safety concern pertains to the lifted vehicle's bumper height from the ground. Having completed the required Rough Terrain Forklift Training will also keep your company in compliance.
