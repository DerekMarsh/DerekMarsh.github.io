<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48‚Äù will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work. One major difference between a forklift and a car is stability. That's why we invest heavily in keeping our rental fleet in optimum condition.
