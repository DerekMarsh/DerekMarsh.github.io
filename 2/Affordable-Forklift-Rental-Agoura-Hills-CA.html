Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
<p>To be fair, lifted trucks are not for everyone, however, and there are some drawbacks that go along with their advantages.
