An average forklift has a weight capacity of around 5,000 lbs(2268KG).</p>
<h2>Pallet Trucks Market, Pallet Jack Market Gold Canyon </h2>
<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The forklift's center of gravity moves when you accelerate, brake, or turn. With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>
<p>Powered industrial trucks, commonly called forklifts or lift trucks, are used in many industries, primarily to move materials.

Hand trucks lift the load a few inches off the ground, so they meant to be carrying things for long distances or extended periods.</p>

With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications.</p>
