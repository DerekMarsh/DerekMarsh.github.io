Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>
<p>There's a lot to love about lifted trucks but, simply put, they're not for everyone. Twin tube, monotube, and reservoir models are all available for anything you're taking on. For advanced off-roading rigs, we have you covered with shocks fitted for lifted suspensions as well as lift kits for DIY upgrades.

<p>Picking out the right lift kit height means you'll need to know a little bit more about how certain lift heights will affect your vehicle's performance and what they are generally used for. It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts. Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
