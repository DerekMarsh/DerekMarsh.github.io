<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>While they move heavy loads and increase efficiency, forklifts can also cause serious injuries when they are used unsafely. Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>

<h3>Forklift Operator Safety Training Clayton NC</h3>
<p>1993 SANDERSON SB 304 PLANTMAN 4WD FORKLIFT Fitted with 4.5 TIP FL mast & full cab. The handle shall be mounted in such manner that the operator will steer with his left hand when facing the load end of the truck. The telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift is generally manufactured in separate, functional group sections: hydraulics, powertrain (engine, transmission, etc.), electrical, chassis, and boom.</p>
<p>This allows the reach truck to place pallets of products into shelving. All forklift operators should be certified and keep their training up to date, for their safety and that of those around them. With solutions for indoor and outdoor operations, warehouse and distribution centers to rugged terrain applications, we have the right forklift for your business when you need it.</p>

ICE forklifts can handle loads of up to 15,500 pounds and are ideal for indoor operation on smooth floors. Most rough terrain forklifts within this range are run by a single joystick that controls all boom functions and hydraulics for simple and efficient operation.</p>
