A conveyor, overhead hoist, or equivalent material handling equipment shall be provided for handling batteries. Off-road forklifts are suitable for almost any environment (construction sites, docks, forests, etc.), they offer increased mobility and excellent results in areas where the terrain is rough. An unloaded forklift can also tip from the weight of the counterbalance, so safe driving is just ask important with an unloaded lift.</p>

<h2>Pallet Jacks And Their Usage Valley Springs </h2>
<p>3. 3 Acknowledgment OSHA's Office of Training and Education wishes to acknowledge the following for contributing some of the graphics used in this presentation:  Caterpillar Lift Trucks  Mason Contractors Association of America  Industrial Truck Association  State of Utah Labor Commission - Occupational Safety & Health Division  Steamship Trade Association of Baltimore  Taylor Machine Works, Inc.</p>
<p>Double-deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay. We are known as a 'One Stop Shop' for material handling equipment. The mast shall be at full rearward tilt and the forks the elevated until the point of intersection of the two load-carrying surfaces of the forks is 12 inches from the floor.</p>
<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>
