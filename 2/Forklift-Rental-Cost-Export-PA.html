<p>Before you decide to lift your truck, it's important to understand some of the pros and cons of driving a lifted vehicle. If your forklift is overloaded, it can cause it to tip to the side when you turn or when you are near a steep edge. Forklifts run on diesel, liquid propane and electric. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
<p>Rough Terrain Forklift Safety Training Matters. Test N5 - both reach and straddle trucks (except with tilting mast) - stability is usually obvious, in which case test may be waived. Browse our selection of lifted Ford, Chevy, and Dodge lifted trucks. Faster travel, lift and lower speeds reduce order picking time, the most labour intensive materials handling function.</p>
