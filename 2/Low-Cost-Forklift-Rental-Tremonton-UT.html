<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load at full rearward tilt of the mast and with the load elevated 12 inches from the floor, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

Use: Most commonly used forklift in the U.S. Primarily used indoors in warehouse type operations, good for use on smooth surfaces only. Overall Height Raised = The maximum extended height of the top of the load backrest or fork carriage of a completely extended mast.</p>

Hand Pallet Truck with Scale is an excellent economic solution for all weighing requirements in busy warehouse environments , which allows you to weigh cargo where you want and when you want. If any of the foregoing trucks is equipped with attachments, the rated capacity shall be expressed in pounds at a specified load center and for a specified load elevation.</p>

These are classifications of six commonly-used types of forklifts, as recognized by OSHA, along with different types of trucks unique to each class.
