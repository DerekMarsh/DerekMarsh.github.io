<p>The fork lift truck used for the training at Coleg Menai is GAS OPERATED. Failure to secure truck or trailer with blocks can cause the trailer to move resulting in the forklift falling between the trailer and the dock. First, take the time to train your whole crew to use rough terrain forklifts. The Air Lift compressor will mount onto your vehicle's frame while you will run the air line tubing from the compressor to your air springs.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>

The added bonus with this machine is that it has a turning circle of just 2.5 m, compared to a standard forklift with fork extensions at 3.7 m,” says Murray. Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
