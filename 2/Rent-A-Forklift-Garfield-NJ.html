<h2>Be Aware When Operating a Fork Lift Truck in Garfield </h2>

Consider what you will be using your forklift for and what processes you want to optimise before choosing any new machinery and training employees.

Whether you're looking for an energy efficient electric forklift , an LP-gas forklift , a high-capacity diesel lift truck , or specialty equipment to handle the most strenuous heavy lifting projects, our rental fleet of high performance Hyster and Yale forklifts is at your service.</p>
