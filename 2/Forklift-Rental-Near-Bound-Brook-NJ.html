<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>

The AUSA 3000-3500 kg forklifts are compact, have a high-performance hydrostatic transmission and are available in 2-wheel drive and 4x4 versions. Lift trucks use either gasoline-powered engines, diesel engines, or electric motors, with the power supplied by a rechargable industrial battery.</p>
<p>Texas First Rentals San Antonio is a sister company of HOLT CAT®, the largest Caterpillar dealer in the United States. Body Lift Kit: If you're interested in getting more off-road capabilities but are still on a somewhat limited budget, go the middle ground with a body lift kit, which includes adding spacers between the body and frame to give you more space for off-road tires.</p>
<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
