<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>We sell, rent and service a wide variety of forklift makes and models. United Rentals deploys over $11.6 billion of fleet. The auto loan experts at our Dallas lease department will make absolutely sure you can get the best rates on any Chevrolet Silverado lifted truck. In 2000, OSHA issued an ergonomics standard. Dillon Toyota Lift's expert instructors offer forklift operator training and train the trainer courses to keep you OSHA compliant.</p>

<p>I appreciate the informative post and pictures you have shared of different types of forklifts. This is highlighted by the impressive load capacity: Our low-level order pickers, for instance, can lift up to three pallets weighing up to 2.5 tons with their 2.4 metre long forks. The forklift training material fit our training needs nicely. They are more maneuverable and need less space to operate than sit-down forklifts.</p>

<p>Our manoeuvrable and versatile EFG counterbalance forklift trucks are designed for maximum performance at minimum energy consumption: latest generation 3-phase AC motors, highest efficiency thanks to PureEnergy concept, productivity-enhancing ergonomics and optimum safety. In the material handling industry, the uses of the electric forklift and electric reach stacker are both steadily increasing.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>
