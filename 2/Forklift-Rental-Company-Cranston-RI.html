<p>First forklifts appeared already in the early 20th century, and were used in World War II. Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors. One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking. Our hand pallet jack import data solutions meet your actual import requirements in quality, volume, seasonality, and geography.</p>
<p>The other concept to understand is the forklift's center of gravity. We rent the following forklift equipment: Caterpillar, Jungheinrich, and Harlo.

Of course, Chevrolet already produces a number of fantastic off-road trucks with dedicated trims designed to take on a wide range of trails out there. They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>

Our forklifts are ready for immediate pickup or delivery.
