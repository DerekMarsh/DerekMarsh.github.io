<p>Safety features of this forklift truck include a high-visibility overhead guard, an emergency power disconnect switch, electric horn, and an anti-static ground strap. Manual pallet jacks have existed since at least 1918. Heavy loads and the shifting center-of-gravity can tip a forklift over if it goes too fast. For intricate indoor operations, reach forklift trucks can provide drivers with another set of eyes when they are handling a robust inventory.</p>
<p>Most counterbalanced forklifts have a three-point suspension system, meaning that the truck is supported at the two front wheels and the center of the steer axle.

<p>Firstly, a different training course is required for each type of forklift you wish to operate. Rough terrain pallet jacks 5 are designed specifically for use on uneven ground. Order-pickers and drivers of powered high-lift trucks face a variety of hazards that require training on compliant standards and practices, truck operational procedures, working surfaces and conditions, as well as fall protection training.</p>
<p>Great customer service, I highly recommend the team at Damoli Forklifts. Lift Capacity: 2000 lbs. For trucks with tilting masts the mast shall be vertical or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. We asked the experts and were referred to the Cal OSHA General Industry Safety Order 3656 for Order Pickers and Stocker Pickers for the answers. Rough Terrain lift trucks, which are Class 7 forklifts, require separate operator training.</p>
