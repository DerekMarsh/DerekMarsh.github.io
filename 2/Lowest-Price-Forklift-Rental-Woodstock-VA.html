You'll now be able to see further down the road and over other vehicles. The conditions on site at construction, mining, forestry, and similar jobs are too tough for ordinary forklifts.</p>

<h2>Forklifts & Lift Trucks Woodstock </h2>
<p>Importantly, the electric pallet jack has been built with safety reverse button as well as the good quality steel. The four-wheel versions are Class 4 forklifts. The AUSA 3000-3500 kg forklifts are compact, have a high-performance hydrostatic transmission and are available in 2-wheel drive and 4x4 versions. Lift trucks use either gasoline-powered engines, diesel engines, or electric motors, with the power supplied by a rechargable industrial battery.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>First, we assembled 105 different kinds of forklifts from all walks of industrial life. Forklifts are also organized based on their classification. We highly recommend that you consult with us on which unit is best suited to your needs and that you discuss the best forklift rentals with our team to ensure that you streamline material handling processes within your business and keep related costs low at the same time.</p>
